          <h2>New Life for a Mid-Century Legacy</h2>
          <p>A couple asked for guidance in house selection, and for design of renovations. For its outstanding views and mid-century design, Randy Hudson advised buying this house. The owners wanted to connect to the steep site for outdoor living, and to modernize while respecting the house.</p>
          <p>The living (middle) floor received a new kitchen, family entry and rebuilt deck. On the top floor, Hudson combined 2 bedrooms into a new master suite with panoramic windows. The lower level has an office, recreation area, and patio. The house received new baths and doorways. Paneling and oak floors were refinished. The owner air-conditioned the house via a split system added to existing radiant heating, upgraded with an ultrahigh-efficiency boiler.</p>
          <p>Mahogany siding was repainted and partly replaced with cedar, and roof/wall insulation added; windows and doors were replaced. Nodding to the house’s soft modernism, its &ldquo;ladies’ white glove&rdquo; board railings were maintained.</p>
          <p>A new 1-car garage is set off from the house by outdoor stairs and a view slot to the mountains. The front yard’s boldly graphic driveway and lawn contrast with the lush, private rear yard.<br /><span class="gallery-stats">Renovation and Addition  3100 sf</span></p>

          <h2>Black Tower, White House</h2>
          <p>A sleek 1960s home needed space for living, work and visiting family. The owners, an interior designer and an artist, engaged with HUDSON to reimagine the house. Flexibility was key: studio, entertaining and sleeping areas adaptable day to day and long-term.</p>
          <p>A new living room and bath fills in the upper level of the existing double-height studio. A new tower addition descends the hillside, housing a bedroom above and airy studio/guest spaces below. A cascading stair links all three levels. There are new views and access to the home’s terraced gardens.</p>
          <p>The black tower is clad in shou sugi ban, traditional Japanese charred cedar. It takes a cue from its namesake WB Yeats poem. Rather than compete with austere lines of the existing house, the tower creates its own presence in the garden.</p>
          <p><strong>Reviews:</strong> "Beautiful!" "Amazing studio atmosphere." "Kick-ass abode!" "Nice casa, good going." " Love the new digs."  "Your house is so frigging cool." "Dynamite studio." "What a wonderful place to work."</p>

          <h2>New Home in a Historic Village</h2>
          <p>On a quiet village residential street was a perfect home site. A retired couple approached HUDSON to design a home for their next phase of life.</p>
          <p>A two-story house provides first-floor living, home office and owners' suite. Upstairs are guest bedrooms and an "away room" for hobbies. Living and dining rooms wrap around a screened porch to form a three-season indoor-outdoor entertaining area with views of the private rear yard.</p>
          <p>Although there were no historic design requirements, the owners requested a house that was a good neighbor without being a "historic replica". The house's forms and materials harmonize with those of homes on the street and in the neighborhood.</p>
          <p>As in other Village houses, the detached garage is placed off the alley in the rear yard, and is clad in unpainted pine board-and-batten siding.<br /><span class="gallery-stats">New Construction 2600 sf</span></p>

          <h2>High-Performance Home: Passive Solar Design in a Traditional Package</h2>
          <p>A family needed a house with an artist’s studio. Designed as a compound, the house, garage and studio buildings are separated for views and appreciation of the setting in all weather. Snug living and family spaces with beamed ceilings face south. The breakfast area faces the morning sun; a deep porch provides summer shade for the  living room. A double-height dining room separates the children’s bedrooms above from the parents’ bedroom suite.</p>
          <p>The design greatly reduces the need for fossil fuels; windows admit winter warmth, and superinsulation and north-facing service spaces buffer the house from winter cold. A Rumford fireplace and a woodstove are focal points of family gatherings. A geothermal system provides efficient heating and cooling.</p><p>Materials, inside and out, are traditional: wood board-and-batten siding; local brick; reclaimed heart pine flooring. The property, with its native plants and natural meadows, is an NWF-certified Wildlife Habitat.<br /><span class="gallery-stats">New Construction  4200 sf</span></p>

          <h2>Coastal Living Honors New England Architecture</h2>
          <p>A Manhattan couple planned to build a house in New Hampshire, in harmony with its rocky coastal setting near a historic village. Randy Hudson advised on planning, materials selection and architectural choices to help them achieve the authenticity they were seeking, and to ensure that the space layout worked with the way they lived.  A local architect was responsible for the overall plan, design and construction documents.</p>
          <p>The land side of the house contains entryways, kitchen and service spaces. Living areas are ranged along the sea side. The breakfast area, dining and living, and bedrooms overlook a tree-framed inlet. Transom windows allow daylight from the high ceilings to flow between rooms.</p>
          <p>New England architecture informed the choice of materials. Exteriors are clad in painted cedar shingles with wood trim. Local granite forms the steps, site walls and paving. Construction documents were executed by Architect of Record DeStefano Architects.<br /><span class="gallery-stats"> New Construction  4500 sf</span></p>

          <p>Randy Hudson was engaged during construction to plan materials, details, finishes and colors for this new Net-Zero Energy &ldquo;modern American farmhouse&rdquo; and 57-acre organic farm. In addition, Randy developed outdoor pathways and spaces including patios, decks and walks, to take advantage of the stunning views.</p>
          <p>Exteriors include fiber-reinforced cement board-and-batten siding, stucco walls and slate patios. Interiors include hickory floors, wood roof trusses, plank ceilings, and Shaker-inspired door and window detailing.<br /><span class="gallery-stats">New Construction  2200 sf</span></p>

          <h2>Hamptons Cottage Interior Remodel and Energy Retrofit</h2>
          <p>The architect’s family house on Long Island’s East End had been neglected, but it was attractive and well-built. With a limited budget, priorities were set: Phase One was to restore the home for comfort and attractiveness: Replace kitchen and bathrooms; provide new window treatments; repaint interiors. Phase Two was replacement of the oil furnace and hot-water radiators with an energy-efficient geothermal HVAC system with internet-monitored functions. This entailed significant wall patching and repair in all spaces.</p>
          <p>Several partitions were removed for better daylight and furniture layout. Simple design, and a minimal material and color palette, reflect the house’s New England origins.</p>
          <p>Older trees and plantings were selectively edited out and replaced with new native and flowering species.<br /><span class="gallery-stats">Renovation  1500 sf</span></p>

          <h2>‘Tuscan’ Retreat on a Pennsylvania Hilltop</h2>
          <p>This new house, on a 14-acre rural hilltop, is designed for year-round outdoor living. A living wing and a sleeping wing wrap around a south-facing entertaining terrace, sheltering it from prevailing winds. An outdoor fireplace anchors the space.</p>
          <p>Living spaces are open from the breakfast area through the kitchen dining and into the living room, which has wood-clad tray ceilings. The house has supplemental heating from a Rumford fireplace and a woodstove. Floors are reclaimed antique pine planks.</p>
          <p>Their children now grown, the owners operate the house as a destination bed and breakfast. The wife, a master gardener, manages extensive flower and kitchen gardens; fragrant herbs line the spaces between the entertaining terrace’s paving stones. A dining pergola overlooks rolling hills toward the sunset.</p>
          <p>The house is wrapped in natural materials including cedar siding; local brick foundations and fireplaces; and native bluestone walkways, terrace and entry porch.<br /><span class="gallery-stats"> New Construction  3700 sf</span></p>
